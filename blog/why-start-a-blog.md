Why start a blog? Seriously! Like an introduction to your blog, or what, who does that?

I know I probably shouldn't be writing this part, but I am sure it will encourage someone out there. Especially if you're a developer and you do not have a blog yet. Well you don't have to, but hear me out.

I understand that as developers we are always swamped with work to do. So, squeezing the time and energy out to write something down can be a chore. For a long time I faced this problem too and I continued to postpone starting a blog. Today I've decided to write my blog, primarily, to document my thoughts and experiences in the technology space.

You have no idea what mental gymnastics I had to shred in order to get myself to start this. Needless to say, I am happy that I have started. And I hope to find the time to continue to make sure that this space does not collect dust.

Parting thoughts; if sink-opuba with his inertia can do it, I am sure you can.

Thanks for stopping by. -ðŸ‘‹
